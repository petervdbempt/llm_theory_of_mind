step 1: make sure that an LLM can play the game: make sure that it's moves are legal and that it plays to achieve the goal 			DONE

logic checks:
	-double check if trades are actually not being duplicated (it looks fine but we need to be sure)

board improvements:
	-regenerate board and player hands if either player can reach the goal without having to trade

greedy baseline agent improvements: 
	-optional: let them evaluate their own trades in the first round before blindly accepting proposed offer by the other player
