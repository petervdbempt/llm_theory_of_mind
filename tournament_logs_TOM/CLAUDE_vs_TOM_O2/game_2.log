      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: TOM (Order 2)

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(1, 4)): 1xGR, 2xOR, 1xBL

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path to my goal and determine what chips I need.

**Current Position:** row 2, column 2 (BL tile)
**Goal Position:** row 1, column 4 (OR tile)

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (1,4), I need to move:
- 1 row up (from row 2 to row 1)
- 2 columns right (from column 2 to column 4)

Total distance: 3 steps

**Possible paths (moving up first or right first):**

Path 1: Right → Right → Up
- (2,2) → (2,3): GR tile (need GR chip) ✓
- (2,3) → (2,4): GR tile (need GR chip) ✗
- (2,4) → (1,4): OR tile (need OR chip) ✓

Path 2: Right → Up → Right
- (2,2) → (2,3): GR tile (need GR chip) ✓
- (2,3) → (1,3): BL tile (need BL chip) ✓
- (1,3) → (1,4): OR tile (need OR chip) ✓

Path 3: Up → Right → Right
- (2,2) → (1,2): OR tile (need OR chip) ✓
- (1,2) → (1,3): BL tile (need BL chip) ✓
- (1,3) → (1,4): OR tile (need OR chip) ✓

**My current chips:** GR:1, OR:2, BL:1

**Checking Path 2:** GR(1) + BL(1) + OR(1) = I have exactly what I need! ✓
**Checking Path 3:** OR(1) + BL(1) + OR(1) = needs OR:2, BL:1 - I have OR:2, BL:1 ✓

Both Path 2 and Path 3 work with my current chips. I can reach my goal in 3 steps without any trade.

After reaching the goal, I'll have:
- Remaining chips: GR:0, OR:1, BL:0 (if using Path 2) or GR:1, OR:0, BL:0 (if using Path 3)

Since I can already reach my goal optimally without trading, I should PASS.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)
P2 Final Score: 200 (Max Path Score: 200)

WINNER: Player 1 (p1)
