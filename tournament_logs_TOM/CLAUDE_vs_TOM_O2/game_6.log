      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: TOM (Order 2)

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(3, 0)): 1xRE, 2xYE, 1xGR
 - P2 (Goal:(1, 4)): 1xGR, 1xRE, 1xBL, 1xYE

============================================================
ROUND 1
============================================================

--- P1's Turn to Propose ---
[p1] 
========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

GAME STATE (5x5):

YE   RE   YE   GR   BL  
GR   OR   OR   RE   BL

- The top left position in the board is row 0, column 0, the bottom right position is row 4, column 4
- Start position: row 2, column 2
- Goal position: row 3, column 0
- Your chips: {'RE': 1, 'YE': 2, 'GR': 1}
- Opponent's chips: {'GR': 1, 'RE': 1, 'BL': 1, 'YE': 1}
- Negotiation history:
(none)

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path from my start position (2,2) to my goal position (3,0).

**Current Position:** (2,2)
**Goal Position:** (3,0)

**Possible paths to consider:**
1. Down then left: (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0)
   - Tiles: (3,2)=OR, (3,1)=OR, (3,0)=GR
   - Costs: OR, OR, GR
   
2. Left then down: (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0)
   - Tiles: (2,1)=RE, (2,0)=YE, (3,0)=GR
   - Costs: RE, YE, GR

3. Down, left, left: Same as path 1

**My current chips:** RE:1, YE:2, GR:1

**Path 1 analysis:** Need OR:2, GR:1
- I have: GR:1 ✓
- I need: OR:2 (don't have any)

**Path 2 analysis:** Need RE:1, YE:1, GR:1
- I have: RE:1 ✓, YE:2 (need 1) ✓, GR:1 ✓
- This path works! I can reach the goal with my current chips.

Since I can already reach my goal with Path 2 using my current chips (RE:1, YE:1, GR:1), and I'll have YE:1 left over, I should check if there's a better path or if I need to optimize further.

**Scoring for Path 2:**
- 3 steps closer: +300 points
- Reaching goal: +500 points
- Unused chips: 1 YE chip = +50 points
- Total: 850 points (minus negotiation costs)

Since I can already reach my goal optimally, I don't need to trade. Trading would only cost me negotiation points (-1 per round) without benefit.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)
P2 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)

RESULT: TIE
