      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: TOM (Order 1)

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(3, 0)): 1xRE, 2xYE, 1xGR
 - P2 (Goal:(1, 4)): 1xGR, 1xRE, 1xBL, 1xYE

--- P1's Turn to Propose ---
[p1] 
========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the situation:

**My current position:** (2, 2)
**My goal:** (3, 0)

**Path analysis:**
From (2, 2) to (3, 0), I need to move:
- 1 step down (row 2→3)
- 2 steps left (column 2→1→0)

Let me trace possible paths:
1. (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0)
   - Tiles: YE at (2,1), YE at (2,0), GR at (3,0)
   - Cost: YE + YE + GR = 2 YE, 1 GR
   
2. (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0)
   - Tiles: YE at (3,2), OR at (3,1), GR at (3,0)
   - Cost: YE + OR + GR = 1 YE, 1 OR, 1 GR

3. (2,2) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,0)
   - Tiles: YE at (2,1), OR at (3,1), GR at (3,0)
   - Cost: YE + OR + GR = 1 YE, 1 OR, 1 GR

**My chips:** RE: 1, YE: 2, GR: 1

For path 1: I have 2 YE ✓ and 1 GR ✓ - I can complete this path!
For paths 2&3: I need 1 OR which I don't have.

**Current situation:**
- Path 1 works perfectly with my current chips (2 YE + 1 GR)
- I would use all these chips and have 1 RE left
- Distance: 3 steps
- Score: 3×100 + 500 + 1×50 = 850 points

Since I already have the exact chips needed to reach my goal via path 1, I don't need to trade. Any trade would only risk losing the chips I need.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)
P2 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)

RESULT: TIE
