      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: GEMINI

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(0, 1)): 2xOR, 1xGR, 1xBL
 - P2 (Goal:(0, 3)): 2xBL, 2xRE

[p1] 
========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path from my start position (2,2) to my goal position (0,1).

**Current position:** (2,2) - BL tile
**Goal position:** (0,1) - YE tile

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (0,1), I need to move:
- 2 rows up (from row 2 to row 0)
- 1 column left (from column 2 to column 1)

Let me trace possible paths:

**Path 1:** (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,1)
- (1,2): GR tile - costs 1 GR
- (0,2): YE tile - costs 1 YE
- (0,1): YE tile - costs 1 YE
- **Total needed:** 1 GR, 2 YE

**Path 2:** (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (0,1)
- (2,1): GR tile - costs 1 GR
- (1,1): BL tile - costs 1 BL
- (0,1): YE tile - costs 1 YE
- **Total needed:** 1 GR, 1 BL, 1 YE

**Path 3:** (2,2) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (0,3) → (0,2) → (0,1)
This is longer (5 steps vs 3 steps).

**My current chips:** OR: 2, GR: 1, BL: 1
**What I need for optimal path:**
- Path 1: 1 GR ✓, 2 YE ✗ (I have 0 YE)
- Path 2: 1 GR ✓, 1 BL ✓, 1 YE ✗ (I have 0 YE)

I need at least 1 YE chip to reach my goal via the shortest path (3 steps). For Path 1, I'd need 2 YE. For Path 2, I'd need 1 YE.

**Opponent's chips:** BL: 2, RE: 2
The opponent doesn't have YE chips to trade.

Since the opponent doesn't have any YE chips, I cannot obtain the chips I need through trade. Let me check if there's any alternative path without YE:

Looking at all adjacent paths without YE chips - none exist to reach (0,1) efficiently since the goal itself is on a YE tile.

Without YE chips, I cannot reach my goal. I should pass and move as close as possible with what I have.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 300 (Max Path Score: 300)
P2 Final Score: 300 (Max Path Score: 300)

RESULT: TIE
