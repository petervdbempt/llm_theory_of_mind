      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: GEMINI

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(0, 0)): 1xOR, 1xRE, 1xGR, 1xBL
 - P2 (Goal:(4, 3)): 1xGR, 1xRE, 1xOR, 1xBL

============================================================
ROUND 1
============================================================

--- P1's Turn to Propose ---
[p1] 
========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

- The top left position in the board is row 0, column 0, the bottom right position is row 4, column 4
- Start position: row 2, column 2
- Goal position: row 0, column 0
- Your chips: {'OR': 1, 'RE': 1, 'GR': 1, 'BL': 1}
- Opponent's chips: {'GR': 1, 'RE': 1, 'OR': 1, 'BL': 1}

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path from my start position (2,2) to my goal position (0,0).

**Current Position:** (2,2)
**Goal Position:** (0,0)

**Possible paths to consider:**
From (2,2) to (0,0), I need to move 2 steps up and 2 steps left (4 moves total).

Let me trace the shortest path:
- (2,2) → (2,1): costs GR
- (2,1) → (2,0): costs RE
- (2,0) → (1,0): costs GR
- (1,0) → (0,0): costs BL

So I need: 2 GR, 1 RE, 1 BL

**My current chips:** OR: 1, RE: 1, GR: 1, BL: 1

**What I'm missing:** 1 more GR chip

**What I have extra:** 1 OR chip (not needed for my path)

Let me check if there are alternative paths:
- Path via (2,2)→(1,2)→(0,2)→(0,1)→(0,0): GR, GR, OR, BL (needs 2 GR, 1 OR, 1 BL)
- Path via (2,2)→(2,1)→(1,1)→(0,1)→(0,0): GR, GR, GR, BL (needs 3 GR, 1 BL - I don't have 3 GR)

The second alternative path uses my OR chip! Let me verify:
- (2,2) → (1,2): costs GR ✓
- (1,2) → (0,2): costs GR (but I only have 1 GR currently)
- (0,2) → (0,1): costs OR ✓
- (0,1) → (0,0): costs BL ✓

This still needs 2 GR chips.

**Best strategy:** I need to trade my extra OR chip for a GR chip to complete my optimal path.

Let me propose: Give OR, Receive GR

{"give": ["OR"], "receive": ["GR"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['OR'] for RECEIVE ['GR']
  -> PROPOSAL: P1 offers to GIVE: ['OR'] for RECEIVING: ['GR'] from P2
