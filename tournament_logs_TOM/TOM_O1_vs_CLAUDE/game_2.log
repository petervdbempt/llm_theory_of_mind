GAME RULES:
- You are Player P2 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P1.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: Let me analyze this situation step by step.

**My Current Position:** Row 2, Column 2 (OR tile)
**My Goal:** Row 3, Column 0 (OR tile)

**Finding the best path to my goal:**
From (2,2) to (3,0), I need to move:
- 1 step down (row 2→3)
- 2 steps left (column 2→1→0)

Possible path: (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0)
- Move to (2,1): YE tile - need YE chip (don't have)
- Move to (2,0): RE tile - need RE chip (have 1)
- Move to (3,0): OR tile - need OR chip (don't have)

Alternative path: (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0)
- Move to (3,2): OR tile - need OR chip (don't have)
- Move to (3,1): YE tile - need YE chip (don't have)
- Move to (3,0): OR tile - need OR chip (don't have)

**My current chips:** BL: 3, RE: 1
**I need:** OR chips and/or YE chips to reach my goal

**The proposed trade:** Give 2 BL chips, receive 1 OR chip

If I accept:
- My chips would be: BL: 1, RE: 1, OR: 1
- I could move to (3,2) using OR
- Then I'd need YE to get to (3,1) - don't have
- I'd be stuck 2 steps away from goal

**Analysis:**
- I need at least 2-3 chips of the right colors to reach my goal (combination of OR, YE, RE)
- Trading 2 BL for 1 OR is not enough - I'd still need YE chips
- This trade gives me only 1 of the several chips I need
- The 2-for-1 exchange rate is unfavorable
- I should reject and try to negotiate a better deal that gets me more of the chips I need (OR and YE)

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: I need to analyze the situation to determine the best trade.

**Current Position:** Row 2, Column 2 (BL tile)
**Goal Position:** Row 3, Column 0 (OR tile)

**Path Analysis:**
From (2,2) to (3,0), I need to find the shortest path:
- Option 1: (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0)
  - Tiles: OR → RE → OR
  - Cost: 1 OR + 1 RE + 1 OR = 2 OR, 1 RE
  
- Option 2: (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0)
  - Tiles: OR → YE → OR
  - Cost: 1 OR + 1 YE + 1 OR = 2 OR, 1 YE

**My Current Chips:** BL: 3, RE: 1
**What I Need:** 2 OR and either 1 RE (which I have) or 1 YE (which I don't have)

So the best path is Option 1, requiring 2 OR chips (I have 0) and 1 RE chip (I have 1).

**Opponent's Chips:** GR: 1, OR: 2, BL: 1

The opponent has exactly 2 OR chips that I need! 

**What can I offer?**
- I have 3 BL chips (valuable to me, but might be useful to opponent)
- I have 1 RE chip (but I need this for my path)

Looking at the opponent's goal position (I should infer from their rejection), they rejected my offer of 2 BL for 1 OR, suggesting they need BL chips or don't want to give up OR easily.

However, I desperately need 2 OR chips. Let me offer all 3 BL chips for the 2 OR chips I need. This is a generous offer (3 for 2) that might be accepted.

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: Let me analyze this situation step by step.

**Current Position:** (2, 2) - This is an OR tile
**Goal Position:** (3, 0) - This is an OR tile

**Path Analysis:**
To get from (2,2) to (3,0), I need to move:
- Down 1: (2,2) → (3,2) - OR tile
- Left 2: (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0) - YE tile, then OR tile

So the path requires: 1 OR + 1 YE + 1 OR = 2 OR and 1 YE

**My Current Chips:** 3 BL, 1 RE
- I have 0 OR and 0 YE
- I cannot reach my goal with current chips

**Opponent's Offer:** Give me 1 OR for 2 BL

**If I Accept:**
- My chips: 1 BL, 1 RE, 1 OR
- I would have 1 OR but still need 1 more OR and 1 YE
- Still cannot reach goal (need 2 OR + 1 YE total)

**My Previous Proposal:** Give 3 BL for 2 OR
- If accepted: I'd have 1 RE, 2 OR
- Still missing 1 YE to reach goal

**Evaluation:**
- Accepting this trade (1 OR for 2 BL) gives me only 1 OR, but I need 2 OR + 1 YE
- Even after the trade, I cannot reach my goal
- I'd be left with fewer chips overall and still unable to complete the path

The opponent's offer is insufficient. I should reject and hope they consider my proposal or make a better counter-offer that gets me closer to having the chips I need (2 OR + 1 YE).

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: I need to analyze the situation:

**Current Position:** (2, 2) - BL tile
**Goal Position:** (3, 0) - OR tile

**Path to goal:**
- (2, 2) → (2, 1) [OR tile] → (2, 0) [RE tile] → (3, 0) [OR tile]
- OR needed: 2 tiles
- RE needed: 1 tile

**My current chips:** BL: 3, RE: 1
**What I need:** OR: 2, RE: 1

I have the RE chip I need, but I need 2 OR chips and currently have 0.

**Opponent's chips:** GR: 1, OR: 2, BL: 1
The opponent has exactly 2 OR chips that I need!

**Negotiation history:**
- I previously rejected P1's offer of 1 OR for 2 BL (twice)
- I proposed giving all 3 BL for 2 OR

Since my previous proposal of 3 BL for 2 OR was rejected, and the opponent keeps offering 1 OR for 2 BL, let me reconsider:

If I accept 1 OR for 2 BL, I'd have:
- BL: 1, RE: 1, OR: 1
- This only gives me 1 OR, but I need 2 OR to reach my goal

I need both OR chips from the opponent. Let me try a different offer - maybe offering 2 BL for 2 OR would be more appealing than 3 BL for 2 OR (which seems like I'm desperate).

Actually, looking at the board, let me verify the opponent's path needs. But my priority is getting those 2 OR chips.

Let me propose: 2 BL for 2 OR

- {"action": "ACCEPT"}
- OR
- {"action": "REJECT"}

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: I need to analyze whether this trade is beneficial for me.

**Current situation:**
- Start: (2, 2) - OR tile
- Goal: (3, 0) - OR tile
- My chips: {'BL': 3, 'RE': 1}
- Opponent's chips: {'GR': 1, 'OR': 2, 'BL': 1}

**Path to goal from (2,2) to (3,0):**
The shortest path requires moving:
1. (2,2) → (2,1) - requires OR chip
2. (2,1) → (2,0) - requires RE chip
3. (2,0) → (3,0) - requires OR chip

So I need: 2 OR chips and 1 RE chip.

**Current capabilities:**
- I have: 3 BL, 1 RE
- I can only make 1 move (to RE at (2,1) then (1,2), but that doesn't help)
- Without OR chips, I cannot reach my goal optimally

**If I accept the trade (give 2 BL, receive 1 OR):**
- My chips: {'BL': 1, 'RE': 1, 'OR': 1}
- I can move: (2,2) → (2,1) using OR
- Then I'm stuck at (2,1) needing another OR to reach (3,0) via (2,0)
- I'd be 1 step closer (100 points) + leftover chips (1 BL + 1 RE = 100 points) = 200 points

**If I reject and continue negotiating:**
- I previously offered 2 BL for 2 OR (which is what I really need)
- The opponent is offering 1 OR for 2 BL (worse deal)
- We're already in round 3 of negotiation

**Optimal scenario:** I need 2 OR chips to reach my goal. The opponent has 2 OR chips.

Since the opponent is only offering 1 OR for 2 BL (when I need 2 OR), this trade doesn't give me enough to reach my goal. I should reject and hope for a better offer, or the opponent might accept my previous proposal of 2 BL for 2 OR.

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: I need to analyze the situation to determine the best trade proposal.

**Current Position:** (2, 2)
**Goal Position:** (3, 0)

**Path Analysis:**
From (2,2) to (3,0), I need to move:
- Down 1: (2,2) → (3,2)
- Left 2: (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0)

The tiles I need to traverse:
1. (3,2): OR
2. (3,1): YE
3. (3,0): OR

**Chips Needed:** OR, YE, OR (need 2 OR and 1 YE)

**My Current Chips:** 3 BL, 1 RE

**Problem:** I don't have the chips I need (OR and YE). I need to trade.

**Opponent's Chips:** 1 GR, 2 OR, 1 BL

**Analysis of Previous Negotiations:**
- I've been trying to get 2 OR from opponent by offering my BL chips
- P1 has rejected all my offers (even 2 BL for 2 OR, and 3 BL for 2 OR)
- P1 keeps offering 1 OR for 2 BL, which I've rejected

**Current Situation:**
- This is round 5 (the final negotiation round)
- If I don't make a deal now, negotiation ends and I can't reach my goal
- P1 has 2 OR chips, which I desperately need
- I still need 1 YE chip as well, which P1 doesn't have

**Critical Realization:**
Even if I get 2 OR from P1, I still need 1 YE chip to complete my path. Looking at P1's chips, they don't have YE. This means I cannot reach my goal regardless of what trade I make with P1.

Without the ability to reach my goal, I should:
1. Try to get as close as possible
2. Maximize unused chip points

If I accept P1's standing offer (1 OR for 2 BL), I could move one step closer. But that only gets me +100 points and leaves me with 1 BL, 1 RE, 1 OR = +150 for unused chips = 250 total.

If I PASS, I get 0 movement but keep 3 BL + 1 RE = 4 chips × 50 = +200 points.

However, since this is the last round and P1 keeps offering 1 OR for 2 BL, maybe I should accept to at least move one step closer (+100) plus unused chips.

Let me reconsider: With 1 OR, I can move to (3,2). That's 1 step closer = +100. Remaining chips: 1 BL, 1 RE = +100. Total = 200 points minus negotiation penalties.

Actually, I should just PASS since I can't reach the goal anyway and maximize my unused chip value.
