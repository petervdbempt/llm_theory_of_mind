============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: TOM (Order 1)

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(0, 0)): 1xOR, 1xRE, 1xGR, 1xBL

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the situation to determine the best trade.

**My Goal:** Move from (2,2) to (0,0)

**Possible paths to consider:**
1. (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (1,0) → (0,0)
   - Tiles: GR, RE, GR, BL
   - Need: 2 GR, 1 RE, 1 BL

2. (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,1) → (0,0)
   - Tiles: GR, GR, OR, BL
   - Need: 2 GR, 1 OR, 1 BL

3. (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0) → (0,0)
   - Tiles: GR, GR, GR, BL
   - Need: 3 GR, 1 BL

4. (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,0) → (0,0)
   - Tiles: GR, GR, GR, BL
   - Need: 3 GR, 1 BL

5. (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (0,1) → (0,0)
   - Tiles: GR, GR, OR, BL
   - Need: 2 GR, 1 OR, 1 BL

**My current chips:** OR: 1, RE: 1, GR: 1, BL: 1

**Analysis:**
- Path 1 needs: 2 GR, 1 RE, 1 BL (I have 1 GR, 1 RE, 1 BL - missing 1 GR)
- Paths 2 & 5 need: 2 GR, 1 OR, 1 BL (I have 1 GR, 1 OR, 1 BL - missing 1 GR)
- Paths 3 & 4 need: 3 GR, 1 BL (I have 1 GR, 1 BL - missing 2 GR)

The most achievable path requires just 1 additional GR chip. If I can get 1 GR from my opponent, I can reach my goal.

**Best trade:** Give away my RE chip (which I don't need for path 2/5) to get 1 GR chip.

This would give me: OR: 1, GR: 2, BL: 1 - exactly what I need for path 2 or 5!

{"give": ["RE"], "receive": ["GR"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['RE'] for RECEIVE ['GR']
  -> PROPOSAL: P1 offers to GIVE: ['RE'] for RECEIVING: ['GR'] from P2
[ToM1-p2] Evaluating proposal: receive ['RE'], give ['GR']
[ToM1-p2] REJECTING (have better alternatives)
  -> P2 REJECTS the trade.

--- P2's Turn to Propose ---
[ToM1-p2] Generating trade proposal (Order-1)
[ToM1-p2] Best option is to pass
  -> P2 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 1 (Penalty: 1 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 899 (Max Path Score: 900)
P2 Final Score: 250 (Max Path Score: 250)

WINNER: Player 1 (p1)
