============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: TOM (Order 1)

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the situation to determine the best path to my goal and what chips I need.

**Current Position:** (2, 2)
**Goal Position:** (1, 4)

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (1,4), I need to move:
- Up 1 step: from (2,2) to (1,2)
- Right 2 steps: from (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4)

**Path tiles and required chips:**
1. (2,2) → (1,2): Tile at (1,2) is OR - need 1 OR chip
2. (1,2) → (1,3): Tile at (1,3) is BL - need 1 BL chip
3. (1,3) → (1,4): Tile at (1,4) is OR - need 1 OR chip

**Total chips needed:** 2 OR, 1 BL

**My current chips:** GR: 1, OR: 2, BL: 1

Perfect! I already have exactly what I need (2 OR and 1 BL). I don't need to trade.

However, let me verify if there's any benefit to trading. After reaching my goal, I would have:
- Used: 2 OR, 1 BL
- Remaining: 1 GR
- Score: 3 steps × 100 + 500 (goal reached) + 1 × 50 (unused chip) = 850 points

Since I already have the exact chips needed for the optimal path, there's no reason to trade. Any trade would either be unnecessary or potentially harmful.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)
P2 Final Score: 200 (Max Path Score: 200)

WINNER: Player 1 (p1)
