========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

[p1] stripped response: Looking at this game, I need to analyze the optimal path to my goal and what chips I need.

**Current situation:**
- Start: (2, 2)
- Goal: (0, 4)
- My chips: YE=3, RE=1
- Opponent's chips: OR=2, YE=1, GR=1

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (0,4), I need to move:
- 2 rows up (from row 2 to row 0)
- 2 columns right (from column 2 to column 4)

Total: 4 moves minimum

**Analyzing possible paths:**
Let me trace an efficient path:
1. (2,2) → (2,3): Costs BL
2. (2,3) → (1,3): Costs RE
3. (1,3) → (0,3): Costs GR
4. (0,3) → (0,4): Costs GR

This path needs: BL=1, RE=1, GR=2

**What I have vs what I need:**
- Need: BL=1, RE=1, GR=2
- Have: YE=3, RE=1
- Missing: BL=1, GR=2
- Excess: YE=3

**Alternative paths to check:**
Let me try going up first:
1. (2,2) → (1,2): Costs RE ✓ (I have 1)
2. (1,2) → (0,2): Costs RE (don't have another)

Another route:
1. (2,2) → (2,3): BL (don't have)

It seems most efficient paths require chips I don't have (BL or GR).

**Trade strategy:**
The opponent has GR=1 which I need. I should try to get GR and possibly other useful colors. I have excess YE chips to trade.

Let me propose trading some of my YE for their GR to help me get closer to the goal.

{"give": ["YE", "YE"], "receive": ["GR"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['YE', 'YE'] for RECEIVE ['GR']
  -> PROPOSAL: P1 offers to GIVE: ['YE', 'YE'] for RECEIVING: ['GR'] from P2
[ToM1-p2] Evaluating proposal: receive ['YE', 'YE'], give ['GR']
[ToM1-p2] ACCEPTING (offer is among best options)
  -> P2 ACCEPTS the trade!
  -> Chips after trade:
     - P1 Chips: {'YE': 1, 'RE': 1, 'GR': 1}
     - P2 Chips: {'OR': 2, 'YE': 3}

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 1 (Penalty: 1 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 199 (Max Path Score: 200)
P2 Final Score: 250 (Max Path Score: 250)

WINNER: Player 2 (p2)
