      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: CLAUDE

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path to my goal and determine what chips I need.

**Current Position:** row 2, column 2 (BL tile)
**Goal Position:** row 1, column 4 (OR tile)

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (1,4), I need to move:
- 1 row up (from row 2 to row 1)
- 2 columns right (from column 2 to column 4)

Total steps needed: 3 moves

**Possible path options:**
1. (2,2) → (2,3) GR → (2,4) GR → (1,4) OR
2. (2,2) → (1,2) OR → (1,3) BL → (1,4) OR
3. (2,2) → (2,3) GR → (1,3) BL → (1,4) OR
4. (2,2) → (1,2) OR → (2,3) GR → (1,4) OR (invalid - not a valid path)

**Valid shortest paths require:**
- Path 1: GR, GR, OR (need 2 GR, 1 OR)
- Path 2: OR, BL, OR (need 2 OR, 1 BL)
- Path 3: GR, BL, OR (need 1 GR, 1 BL, 1 OR)

**My current chips:** GR: 1, OR: 2, BL: 1

Checking each path:
- Path 1: Need 2 GR, 1 OR → I have 1 GR, 2 OR (missing 1 GR)
- Path 2: Need 2 OR, 1 BL → I have 2 OR, 1 BL ✓ **Can complete!**
- Path 3: Need 1 GR, 1 BL, 1 OR → I have 1 GR, 1 BL, 2 OR ✓ **Can complete!**

I can already reach my goal with my current chips! Path 2 uses: OR, BL, OR (exactly what I need, with 1 GR left over).

After reaching the goal:
- Score: 3 steps × 100 = 300 points
- Reaching goal: +500 points
- Unused chips: 1 GR = 50 points
- Total: 850 points (minus negotiation rounds)

Since I can already reach my goal optimally, I should PASS to avoid wasting negotiation rounds.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)
P2 Final Score: 200 (Max Path Score: 200)

WINNER: Player 1 (p1)
