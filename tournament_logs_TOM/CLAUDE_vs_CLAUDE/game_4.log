==============================================

[p1] stripped response: Looking at this problem, I need to find the optimal path from my start position (2,2) to my goal position (0,4).

Let me analyze the possible paths:

**Path Analysis:**
From (2,2) to (0,4), I need to move 2 rows up and 2 columns right.

One efficient path:
- (2,2) → (2,3): costs BL
- (2,3) → (2,4): costs OR
- (2,4) → (1,4): costs GR
- (1,4) → (0,4): costs GR

This path requires: 1 BL, 1 OR, 2 GR

**My current chips:** YE×3, RE×1
**What I need:** BL×1, OR×1, GR×2

I don't have any of the chips I need! I must trade to get them.

**Opponent's chips:** OR×2, YE×1, GR×1

The opponent has:
- OR×2 (I need 1)
- GR×1 (I need 2)

Let me check alternative paths to see if I can minimize what I need:

Alternative path (going left first):
- (2,2) → (1,2): costs RE ✓
- (1,2) → (0,2): costs RE (don't have)
- Then right would need GR×2

Alternative path (going right then up):
- (2,2) → (2,3): costs BL
- (2,3) → (1,3): costs BL  
- (1,3) → (0,3): costs GR
- (0,3) → (0,4): costs GR
Needs: BL×2, GR×2

Let me try:
- (2,2) → (2,1): costs YE ✓
- (2,1) → (1,1): costs RE ✓
- (1,1) → (0,1): costs YE ✓
- (0,1) → (0,2): costs RE (don't have)
- (0,2) → (0,3): costs GR (don't have)
- (0,3) → (0,4): costs GR (don't have)

The best strategy is to trade for chips that allow me to reach the goal. Since the opponent has OR×2 and GR×1, I should try to get those plus find a way to get BL.

However, the opponent doesn't have BL. Let me reconsider paths that avoid BL:

Path avoiding BL:
- (2,2) → (2,1): costs YE ✓
- (2,1) → (1,1): costs RE ✓
- (1,1) → (1,2): costs RE (need 1 more)
- (1,2) → (1,3): costs BL (stuck)

Best trade: Get OR and GR from opponent. I'll offer my YE and RE chips.

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: I need to analyze whether this trade helps me reach my goal.

**Current Position:** (2, 2)
**Goal Position:** (0, 3)

**Path Analysis:**
From (2,2) to (0,3), I need to move:
- 2 steps up (north)
- 1 step right (east)

Let me trace the optimal path:
- (2,2) → (1,2): Need RE chip
- (1,2) → (0,2): Need RE chip  
- (0,2) → (0,3): Need GR chip

**Total chips needed:** 2 RE + 1 GR

**Current chips:** OR=2, YE=1, GR=1
- I have the GR I need
- I don't have any RE chips
- I cannot reach my goal with current chips

**Proposed Trade:**
- Give away: OR, GR
- Receive: YE, RE

**After trade my chips would be:** OR=1, YE=2, RE=1, GR=0

Wait, let me reconsider. I need 2 RE and 1 GR. After this trade:
- I would have only 1 RE (need 2)
- I would have 0 GR (need 1)

This trade makes my situation worse! I currently have 1 GR which I need, but this trade takes it away.

Let me check if there's an alternative path:
- (2,2) → (2,3): Need BL
- (2,3) → (1,3): Need RE
- (1,3) → (0,3): Need GR

This also needs chips I don't have.

Or:
- (2,2) → (1,2): Need RE
- (1,2) → (1,3): Need RE
- (1,3) → (0,3): Need GR

Same problem - need 2 RE + 1 GR.

**Verdict:** The trade gives me only 1 RE when I need 2, and takes away my GR when I need 1. This trade does NOT help me reach my goal. Without the right chips, I should keep what I have and reject this trade.

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: I need to analyze my situation and determine the best trade.

**Current Position:** (2, 2)
**Goal Position:** (0, 3)

**Path to Goal:**
From (2,2) to (0,3), I need to move:
- Up 2 rows (from row 2 to row 0)
- Right 1 column (from column 2 to column 3)

Let me trace the optimal path:
- (2,2) → (1,2): costs RE
- (1,2) → (0,2): costs RE
- (0,2) → (0,3): costs GR

**Total chips needed:** 2 RE, 1 GR

**My current chips:** OR: 2, YE: 1, GR: 1

I have the GR I need, but I'm missing 2 RE chips. I need to trade for RE chips.

**Opponent's chips:** YE: 3, RE: 1

The opponent only has 1 RE chip, which isn't enough for my needs. However, let me reconsider if there's an alternative path:

Alternative paths:
1. (2,2) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (0,3): costs BL, RE, GR (need 1 BL, 1 RE, 1 GR)
2. (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (0,3): costs RE, RE, GR (need 2 RE, 1 GR)
3. (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3): costs YE, RE, YE, YE, GR (need 3 YE, 1 RE, 1 GR)

Path 3 requires 3 YE, 1 RE, 1 GR. The opponent has exactly 3 YE and 1 RE!

If I trade my OR (2) and possibly get YE (3) and RE (1), I could take this longer path.

Let me propose: Give 2 OR, receive 3 YE and 1 RE
This would give me: YE: 4, GR: 1, RE: 1

With this, I could take path 3: costs 3 YE, 1 RE, 1 GR = 5 moves
I'd have YE: 1, GR: 0, RE: 0 left = 1 unused chip

Score: 5 × 100 + 500 + 1 × 50 - 2 = 1048 points

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: Let me analyze this trade offer carefully.

**Current situation:**
- My position: (2, 2)
- My goal: (0, 4)
- My chips: YE=3, RE=1

**Path analysis without trade:**
From (2,2) to (0,4), I need to go 2 rows up and 2 columns right = 4 moves.

Possible path: (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (0,4)
Tiles: RE → BL → OR → GR → GR
Required chips: RE=1, BL=1, OR=1, GR=2

I have: YE=3, RE=1
Missing: BL=1, OR=1, GR=2 (I cannot complete this path!)

Alternative path: (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4)
Tiles: RE → RE → RE → GR → GR
Required chips: RE=3, GR=2

I only have RE=1, so I can't complete this either.

**With opponent's trade:**
- I give: YE=3, RE=1 (all my chips!)
- I receive: OR=2
- New chips: OR=2

With only OR=2, I can move at most 2 steps on orange tiles. Looking at the board, I cannot reach my goal with just 2 orange chips.

**Analysis:**
This trade would leave me with only 2 orange chips, severely limiting my movement options. I would lose all my yellow and red chips, which are more versatile given the board layout. This is a very unfavorable trade.

The opponent is asking for all 4 of my chips in exchange for just 2 chips. Even if those orange chips were useful, the 4-for-2 exchange rate is terrible, and the resulting chip set doesn't help me reach my goal.

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the situation:

**My current position:** (2, 2)
**My goal:** (0, 4)
**My chips:** YE: 3, RE: 1

**Path analysis:**
From (2,2) to (0,4), I need to move:
- 2 steps up (from row 2 to row 0)
- 2 steps right (from column 2 to column 4)

Let me trace the optimal path:
- (2,2) → (1,2): Need RE chip (tile is RE)
- (1,2) → (0,2): Need RE chip (tile is RE)
- (0,2) → (0,3): Need GR chip (tile is GR)
- (0,3) → (0,4): Need GR chip (tile is GR)

**Required chips:** RE: 2, GR: 2
**My current chips:** YE: 3, RE: 1

I'm missing: RE: 1, GR: 2

**Opponent's chips:** OR: 2, YE: 1, GR: 1

The opponent only has 1 GR chip, but I need 2 GR chips. This is problematic.

Let me check alternative paths:
- Via (2,3): (2,2)→(2,3) needs BL, (2,3)→(1,3) needs RE, (1,3)→(0,3) needs RE, (0,3)→(0,4) needs GR
  Required: BL:1, RE:2, GR:1

- Via (2,1): (2,2)→(2,1) needs YE, (2,1)→(1,1) needs RE, (1,1)→(0,1) needs YE, (0,1)→(0,2) needs RE, (0,2)→(0,3) needs GR, (0,3)→(0,4) needs GR
  Required: YE:2, RE:2, GR:2 (6 moves - longer)

The best alternative seems to be via (2,3):
- Required: BL:1, RE:2, GR:1
- I have: YE:3, RE:1
- I need: BL:1, RE:1, GR:1

The opponent has GR:1 which I desperately need. I should try to get the GR chip.

I'll propose trading some of my YE chips for the opponent's GR chip:

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: Let me analyze this trade offer carefully.

**Current situation:**
- My position: (2, 2)
- My goal: (0, 3)
- My chips: OR=2, YE=1, GR=1

**Path to goal from (2,2) to (0,3):**
Optimal path requires moving:
- Up: (2,2) → (1,2) [costs RE]
- Up: (1,2) → (0,2) [costs RE]
- Right: (0,2) → (0,3) [costs GR]

Total needed: 2 RE + 1 GR

**Problem:** I don't have any RE chips, so I cannot reach my goal with current chips.

**Analyzing the trade offer:**
- Give: GR (1 chip)
- Receive: YE, YE (2 chips)

**After this trade, I would have:**
- OR=2, YE=3, GR=0

**Can I reach goal with these chips?**
Let me check alternative paths:
- Path via yellows: (2,2) → (2,1) [YE] → (1,1) [RE] - still need RE
- Path via (2,3): (2,2) → (2,3) [BL] - don't have BL
- Any path to (0,3) seems to require RE chips, which I don't have

**The critical issue:** 
- To reach my goal at (0,3), I need RED chips (the board shows RE tiles block most efficient paths)
- Trading away my GR for YE doesn't help since I still can't get the RE chips I need
- My previous proposal (give OR,OR for YE,YE,YE,RE) would have given me 1 RE, but that's still not enough for 2 RE needed

**Conclusion:**
This trade makes my situation worse because:
1. I lose the GR chip needed for the final step to goal
2. I gain YE chips but still can't get past the RE tiles
3. Without RE chips, I cannot reach my goal regardless

I should REJECT and try to negotiate for RED chips instead.

- Goal position: row 0, column 3
- Your chips: {'OR': 2, 'YE': 1, 'GR': 1}
- Opponent's chips: {'YE': 3, 'RE': 1}
- Negotiation history:
p2 REJECTED offer (['YE', 'RE'] for ['OR', 'GR']).
p2 proposed trade: GIVE ['OR', 'OR'] for RECEIVE ['YE', 'YE', 'YE', 'RE']
p2 REJECTED offer (['YE', 'YE'] for ['GR']).

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

[p2] stripped response: I need to analyze the situation to determine the best trade proposal.

**Current Position:** (2, 2)
**Goal Position:** (0, 3)

**Optimal Path:**
From (2,2) to (0,3), I need to move:
- Up 2 rows: (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2)
- Right 1 column: (0,2) → (0,3)

**Tiles I need to traverse:**
1. (1,2): RE
2. (0,2): RE  
3. (0,3): GR

**Chips needed:** 2 RE + 1 GR

**My current chips:** OR=2, YE=1, GR=1
- I have the GR I need
- I need 2 RE chips (I have 0)

**Opponent's chips:** YE=3, RE=1
- Opponent has only 1 RE, but I need 2 RE

**Negotiation History:**
1. I rejected P1's offer of [YE, RE] for [OR, GR]
2. I proposed [OR, OR] for [YE, YE, YE, RE] (still waiting for response)
3. I rejected P1's offer of [YE, YE] for [GR]

Since my previous proposal of giving both OR chips for all of P1's chips (3 YE + 1 RE) is pending, and P1 only has 1 RE while I need 2 RE, I cannot reach my goal even with a perfect trade.

However, if I can get that 1 RE, I can get closer:
- With 1 RE and 1 GR, I could move: (2,2) → (1,2) using RE → (0,2) would need another RE (don't have)
- Or: (2,2) → (2,3) using BL (don't have) 

Let me reconsider. Given that P1 only has 1 RE and I need 2 RE, the best I can do is get 1 step closer. But looking at alternative paths... none are better without the right chips.

Since I've already proposed a trade that would give me the maximum chips from P1, and we're in round 4 of negotiation (with a -1 penalty per round), I should either pass or make a minimal beneficial trade.

Given the constraints and that I cannot reach my goal anyway, I'll pass to end negotiation and minimize the penalty.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p2]   [p2] p2 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P2 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 2 (Penalty: 2 points)
P2 Offers Made: 1 (Penalty: 1 points)

P1 Final Score: 248 (Max Path Score: 250)
P2 Final Score: 199 (Max Path Score: 200)

WINNER: Player 1 (p1)
