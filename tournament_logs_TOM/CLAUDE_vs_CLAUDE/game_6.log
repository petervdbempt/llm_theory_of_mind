      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: CLAUDE

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(3, 0)): 1xRE, 2xYE, 1xGR
 - P2 (Goal:(1, 4)): 1xGR, 1xRE, 1xBL, 1xYE

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path from my start position (2,2) to my goal position (3,0).

**Current Position:** (2,2)
**Goal Position:** (3,0)

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (3,0), I need to move:
- 1 step down (row 2 → 3)
- 2 steps left (column 2 → 1 → 0)

Let me trace a possible path:
1. (2,2) → (2,1): Need RE chip (tile at 2,1 is RE)
2. (2,1) → (3,1): Need OR chip (tile at 3,1 is OR)
3. (3,1) → (3,0): Need GR chip (tile at 3,0 is GR)

**Chips needed:** RE, OR, GR
**Chips I have:** RE: 1, YE: 2, GR: 1

I have RE and GR, but I'm missing OR. I need to acquire an OR chip.

**What my opponent has:** GR: 1, RE: 1, BL: 1, YE: 1

My opponent doesn't have OR chips, so I cannot get OR from them directly.

Let me check alternative paths:
- (2,2) → (3,2): Need GR (tile at 3,2 is OR) - wait, tile at 3,2 is OR
- (2,2) → (3,2): Need OR chip
- (3,2) → (3,1): Need OR chip  
- (3,1) → (3,0): Need GR chip

This path also needs 2 OR chips and 1 GR, which is worse.

Another path:
- (2,2) → (2,1): Need RE
- (2,1) → (2,0): Need YE (tile at 2,0 is YE)
- (2,0) → (3,0): Need GR

**This path needs:** RE, YE, GR
**I have:** RE: 1, YE: 2, GR: 1

Perfect! I have all the chips I need for this path. I don't need to trade.

Let me verify:
- Start at (2,2)
- Move to (2,1) - costs RE (I have 1)
- Move to (2,0) - costs YE (I have 2)
- Move to (3,0) - costs GR (I have 1)

Total cost: 1 RE, 1 YE, 1 GR
After moves: 0 RE, 1 YE, 0 GR remaining

This gets me to my goal with 1 YE chip left over.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)
P2 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)

RESULT: TIE
