      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: TOM (Order 2)

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(0, 0)): 1xOR, 1xRE, 1xGR, 1xBL
 - P2 (Goal:(4, 3)): 1xGR, 1xRE, 1xOR, 1xBL

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the best path to my goal and determine what chips I need.

**Current Position:** (2, 2)
**Goal Position:** (0, 0)

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (0,0), I need to move 2 steps up and 2 steps left (4 total moves).

Let me trace possible paths:
- (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (1,0) → (0,0)
  - Tiles: GR, RE, GR, GR, BL
  - Need: 3 GR, 1 RE, 1 BL

- (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0) → (0,0)
  - Tiles: GR, GR, GR, GR, BL
  - Need: 4 GR, 1 BL

- (2,2) → (1,2) → (0,2) → (0,1) → (0,0)
  - Tiles: GR, GR, OR, RE, BL
  - Need: 2 GR, 1 OR, 1 RE, 1 BL

**My current chips:** OR: 1, RE: 1, GR: 1, BL: 1

For path 1, I need: 3 GR, 1 RE, 1 BL
- I have: 1 GR, 1 RE, 1 BL
- Missing: 2 GR

For path 2, I need: 4 GR, 1 BL
- I have: 1 GR, 1 BL
- Missing: 3 GR

For path 3, I need: 2 GR, 1 OR, 1 RE, 1 BL
- I have: 1 GR, 1 OR, 1 RE, 1 BL
- Missing: 1 GR

**Best strategy:** Path 3 only requires 1 additional GR chip!

**Opponent's chips:** GR: 1, RE: 1, OR: 1, BL: 1

I should try to trade for 1 GR chip. I can offer my unused chip after reaching the goal. Since I need OR, RE, GR, GR, and BL for path 3, and I have OR, RE, GR, and BL, I don't have any truly "extra" chips except that I could potentially find a path that doesn't use all colors.

Actually, let me reconsider - I should offer something I won't need. Looking at path 3, I don't need any extra chips beyond what enables that path. But I need 2 GR total and only have 1.

Let me propose trading my OR for their GR... wait, I need OR for path 3.

Actually, the simplest trade: Give something I won't use in the optimal path and get GR. But in path 3, I use all my chips. Let me see if there's a better path or if I should just pass.

Given that I can only get 3 steps closer without the extra GR (I'd run out of GR chips), I should try to get 1 more GR. I'll offer my least critical chip that I could work around.

I'll propose: Give BL, Receive GR
This way I can take a path that uses more GR and less BL if possible.

{"give": ["BL"], "receive": ["GR"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['BL'] for RECEIVE ['GR']
  -> PROPOSAL: P1 offers to GIVE: ['BL'] for RECEIVING: ['GR'] from P2
[ToM2-p2] Evaluating proposal: receive ['BL'], give ['GR']
[ToM2-p2] REJECTING (have better alternatives)
  -> P2 REJECTS the trade.

--- P2's Turn to Propose ---
[ToM2-p2] Generating trade proposal (Order-2)
[ToM2-p2] Best option is to pass
  -> P2 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 1 (Penalty: 1 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 899 (Max Path Score: 900)
P2 Final Score: 250 (Max Path Score: 250)

WINNER: Player 1 (p1)
