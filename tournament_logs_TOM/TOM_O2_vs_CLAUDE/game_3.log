      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: TOM (Order 2)

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path to my goal and determine what chips I need.

**Current State:**
- Start: (2, 2)
- Goal: (3, 0)
- My chips: RE=2, BL=1, OR=1

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (3,0), I need to move:
- 1 step down (row 2→3)
- 2 steps left (column 2→1→0)

Total: 3 steps

**Path Analysis:**
Let me trace possible paths:
1. (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,1) → (3,0)
   - (3,2): YE
   - (3,1): GR
   - (3,0): BL
   - Need: YE=1, GR=1, BL=1

2. (2,2) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,0)
   - (2,1): GR
   - (3,1): GR
   - (3,0): BL
   - Need: GR=2, BL=1

3. (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0)
   - (2,1): GR
   - (2,0): RE
   - (3,0): BL
   - Need: GR=1, RE=1, BL=1

**What I have vs what I need:**
- I have: RE=2, BL=1, OR=1
- Best path option 3 needs: GR=1, RE=1, BL=1

I have BL=1 ✓ and RE=2 ✓ (only need 1)
I need GR=1 ✗ (don't have any)

**Trade proposal:**
I need to get at least 1 GR chip. The opponent has GR=1, YE=2, RE=1.

I can offer:
- OR=1 (I don't need it for my path)
- Extra RE=1 (I have 2, only need 1)

A fair trade would be to give 1 OR or 1 RE for 1 GR.

Let me propose: Give 1 OR, receive 1 GR

This allows me to complete path 3 with GR=1, RE=1, BL=1, and I'll have RE=1 left over.

{"give": ["OR"], "receive": ["GR"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['OR'] for RECEIVE ['GR']
  -> PROPOSAL: P1 offers to GIVE: ['OR'] for RECEIVING: ['GR'] from P2
[ToM2-p2] Evaluating proposal: receive ['OR'], give ['GR']
[ToM2-p2] REJECTING (have better alternatives)
  -> P2 REJECTS the trade.

--- P2's Turn to Propose ---
[ToM2-p2] Generating trade proposal (Order-2)
[ToM2-p2] Best option is to pass
  -> P2 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 1 (Penalty: 1 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 249 (Max Path Score: 250)
P2 Final Score: 300 (Max Path Score: 300)

WINNER: Player 2 (p2)
