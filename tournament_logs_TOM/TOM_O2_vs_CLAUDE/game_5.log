      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Agent Configuration:
 - P1: CLAUDE
 - P2: TOM (Order 2)

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(0, 1)): 2xOR, 1xGR, 1xBL
 - P2 (Goal:(0, 3)): 2xBL, 2xRE

--- P1's Turn to Propose ---

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

[p1] stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path from my start position (2,2) to my goal position (0,1).

**Current Position:** (2,2) - BL tile
**Goal Position:** (0,1) - YE tile

**Possible shortest paths (all 3 steps):**
1. (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (0,1)
   - Tiles: GR, BL, YE
   - Cost: 1 GR, 1 BL, 1 YE

2. (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (0,1)
   - Tiles: RE, BL, YE
   - Cost: 1 RE, 1 BL, 1 YE

3. (2,2) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,0) → (0,0) → (0,1) (5 steps - too long)

**My current chips:** OR: 2, GR: 1, BL: 1
**What I need for path 1:** GR: 1, BL: 1, YE: 1
**What I'm missing:** YE: 1

**What I need for path 2:** RE: 1, BL: 1, YE: 1
**What I'm missing:** RE: 1, YE: 1

Path 1 is better since I only need 1 YE chip.

**Opponent's chips:** BL: 2, RE: 2
The opponent has no YE chips to trade.

Without YE, I cannot reach my goal in 3 steps. Let me check alternative paths:
- Any 4-step path would still require chips I don't have.

Since the opponent doesn't have YE chips, I should evaluate what I can do with my current chips:
- With GR: 1, BL: 1, I can move 2 steps maximum toward the goal
- Best partial path: (2,2) → (2,1) GR → (1,1) BL gets me 2 steps closer

Without being able to get YE from the opponent, there's no beneficial trade that helps me reach my goal. I should PASS and move as far as I can with what I have.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
[p1]   [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.
