      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(3, 4)): 2xYE, 1xGR, 1xRE
 - P2 (Goal:(1, 0)): 1xOR, 2xYE, 1xRE

============================================================
ROUND 1
============================================================

--- P1's Turn to Propose ---

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path from my start position (2,2) to my goal position (3,4).

Current position: (2,2) - This is a BL tile
Goal position: (3,4) - This is a BL tile

Let me find the shortest path:
- From (2,2) to (3,4): I need to move right 2 steps and down 1 step (3 moves total)

Possible path 1: (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (3,4)
- (2,3) is BL - need BL chip
- (2,4) is GR - need GR chip  
- (3,4) is BL - need BL chip
- Total needed: 2 BL, 1 GR

Possible path 2: (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4)
- (3,2) is GR - need GR chip
- (3,3) is YE - need YE chip
- (3,4) is BL - need BL chip
- Total needed: 1 BL, 1 GR, 1 YE

Possible path 3: (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (3,4)
- (2,3) is BL - need BL chip
- (3,3) is YE - need YE chip
- (3,4) is BL - need BL chip
- Total needed: 2 BL, 1 YE

My current chips: YE: 2, GR: 1, RE: 1

For path 2, I need: 1 BL, 1 GR, 1 YE
- I have: 1 GR ✓, 2 YE ✓
- I'm missing: 1 BL

For path 3, I need: 2 BL, 1 YE
- I have: 2 YE ✓
- I'm missing: 2 BL

I need BL chips! The opponent has: OR: 1, YE: 2, RE: 1
The opponent doesn't have BL chips either.

Let me reconsider - maybe I can't reach the goal. Let me see how close I can get:
- With path 2, I have GR and YE, so I can do: (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), getting 2 steps closer
- This uses 1 GR and 1 YE

Since I can't reach the goal without BL chips and the opponent doesn't have any, I should focus on getting as close as possible and keeping unused chips for points.

I don't need to trade since the opponent has no BL chips to offer, and trading away my chips would only reduce my unused chip bonus.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
  [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 300 (Max Path Score: 300)
