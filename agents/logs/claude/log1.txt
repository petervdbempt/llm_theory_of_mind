      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(1, 4)): 1xYE, 2xBL, 1xRE
 - P2 (Goal:(0, 1)): 1xGR, 2xYE, 1xRE

============================================================
ROUND 1
============================================================

--- P1's Turn to Propose ---

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

GAME STATE (5x5):
YE   GR   OR   OR   GR  
RE   YE   RE   BL   BL  
YE   YE   BL   OR   BL  
YE   YE   GR   BL   BL  
BL   OR   GR   OR   BL
- Start position: row 2, column 2
- Goal position: row 1, column 4
- Your chips: {'YE': 1, 'BL': 2, 'RE': 1}
- Opponent's chips: {'GR': 1, 'YE': 2, 'RE': 1}
- Negotiation history:
(none)

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path from my start position (row 2, column 2) to my goal position (row 1, column 4).

**Current position:** (2, 2) - YE tile
**Goal position:** (1, 4) - BL tile

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (1,4), I need to move:
- 1 row up (from row 2 to row 1)
- 2 columns right (from column 2 to column 4)

Total moves needed: 3 steps

**Possible path:**
1. (2,2) → (2,3): Move to RE tile - costs 1 RE
2. (2,3) → (2,4): Move to BL tile - costs 1 BL
3. (2,4) → (1,4): Move to BL tile - costs 1 BL

**Required chips:** 1 RE, 2 BL
**My current chips:** 1 YE, 2 BL, 1 RE

Perfect! I have exactly what I need: 1 RE and 2 BL.

After moving, I will have:
- Used: 1 RE, 2 BL
- Remaining: 1 YE
- Score: 3 steps × 100 = 300 points + 500 (reaching goal) + 50 (1 unused chip) = 850 points

Since I already have all the chips I need to reach my goal optimally, there's no benefit to trading. Any trade would only delay the negotiation (costing -1 point per round) without improving my position.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
  [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)
P2 Final Score: 850 (Max Path Score: 850)

RESULT: TIE
