      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(4, 0)): 3xGR, 1xOR
 - P2 (Goal:(1, 0)): 1xBL, 1xGR, 1xOR, 1xRE

============================================================
ROUND 1
============================================================

--- P1's Turn to Propose ---

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

GAME STATE (5x5):
YE   BL   OR   OR   GR  
BL   BL   GR   OR   RE  
YE   GR   YE   BL   BL  
YE   GR   RE   GR   GR  
OR   YE   BL   RE   OR
- Start position: row 2, column 2
- Goal position: row 4, column 0
- Your chips: {'GR': 3, 'OR': 1}
- Opponent's chips: {'BL': 1, 'GR': 1, 'OR': 1, 'RE': 1}
- Negotiation history:
(none)

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path from my start position (2,2) to my goal position (4,0).

**Current position:** (2,2)
**Goal position:** (4,0)

Let me trace the path:
- From (2,2) to (4,0), I need to go 2 rows down and 2 columns left.

**Possible path:**
1. (2,2) → (2,1): tile is GR - costs 1 GR
2. (2,1) → (2,0): tile is YE - costs 1 YE
3. (2,0) → (3,0): tile is YE - costs 1 YE
4. (3,0) → (4,0): tile is OR - costs 1 OR

**Required chips:** 1 GR, 2 YE, 1 OR
**My current chips:** 3 GR, 1 OR

I have the GR and OR I need, but I'm missing 2 YE chips.

Let me check what my opponent needs:
- Opponent's position: (2,2) (same as mine)
- Opponent's goal: Not specified in the problem, but they have: 1 BL, 1 GR, 1 OR, 1 RE

Since I need 2 YE chips and I have 2 extra GR chips (I only need 1 GR for my path), I should try to trade my excess GR chips for YE chips.

Looking at the opponent's chips, they don't have any YE chips to trade. This means I cannot complete my optimal path even with a trade.

Let me explore alternative paths that use only my available chips (GR and OR):

Alternative path avoiding YE:
- (2,2) → (2,3): tile is BL - costs 1 BL (don't have)
- (2,2) → (3,2): tile is YE - costs 1 YE (don't have)
- (2,2) → (1,2): tile is GR - costs 1 GR ✓

Since I can't reach my goal with my current chips and the opponent doesn't have YE chips, I should PASS and try to get as close as possible with what I have.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
  [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 300 (Max Path Score: 300)
P2 Final Score: 300 (Max Path Score: 300)

RESULT: TIE
