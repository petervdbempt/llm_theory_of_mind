      COLORED TRAILS: STARTING NEGOTIATION LOG
============================================================

Initial Chip Distribution (Player Hands):
 - P1 (Goal:(4, 4)): 2xOR, 1xRE, 1xBL
 - P2 (Goal:(0, 4)): 3xRE, 1xBL

============================================================
ROUND 1
============================================================

--- P1's Turn to Propose ---

========== LLM PROMPT (p1) ==========

GAME RULES:
- You are Player P1 in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player P2.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round

GAME STATE (5x5):
BL   OR   YE   BL   YE  
BL   OR   BL   OR   GR  
OR   OR   YE   OR   OR  
RE   RE   BL   YE   GR  
RE   OR   YE   BL   OR
- Start position: row 2, column 2
- Goal position: row 4, column 4
- Your chips: {'OR': 2, 'RE': 1, 'BL': 1}
- Opponent's chips: {'RE': 3, 'BL': 1}
- Negotiation history:
(none)

WHAT TO DO:
- You are allowed to propose ONE trade
- Respond with ONLY the proposed trade in the JSON format below:
- {"give": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...], "receive": ["COLOR1", "COLOR2", ...]}
- If you don't need any trade, output:
- {"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}

==============================================

stripped response: I need to analyze the optimal path to my goal and determine what chips I need.

**Current Position:** (2, 2) - row 2, column 2
**Goal Position:** (4, 4) - row 4, column 4

**Finding the shortest path:**
From (2,2) to (4,4), I need to move:
- 2 rows down (from row 2 to row 4)
- 2 columns right (from column 2 to column 4)

This is 4 moves total.

**Analyzing possible paths:**
Let me trace one efficient path:
1. (2,2) → (2,3): Tile is BL - need BL chip
2. (2,3) → (3,3): Tile is YE - need YE chip
3. (3,3) → (4,3): Tile is YE - need YE chip
4. (4,3) → (4,4): Tile is GR - need GR chip

**Chips needed:** 1 BL, 2 YE, 1 GR
**Chips I have:** 2 OR, 1 RE, 1 BL

I have the BL chip, but I'm missing:
- 2 YE chips
- 1 GR chip

**What opponent has:** 3 RE, 1 BL

The opponent doesn't have YE or GR chips either, so they can't help me get closer to my goal.

Let me check if there's an alternative path that uses chips I have or can obtain:

Alternative paths all require YE and/or GR chips which neither player has.

**Analysis:** Since the opponent doesn't have the chips I need (YE and GR), and I don't have chips they likely need for their goal, a trade won't help me reach my goal. I should PASS and move as far as I can with my current chips.

With my current chips (2 OR, 1 RE, 1 BL), I can potentially move 1-2 steps closer depending on available paths using OR, RE, or BL tiles.

{"give": ["PASS"], "receive": ["PASS"]}
  [p1] p1 proposed trade: GIVE ['PASS'] for RECEIVE ['PASS']
  -> P1 passes. Negotiation ends.

============================================================
--- NEGOTIATION PHASE ENDED ---

--- FINAL RESULTS ---
P1 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)
P2 Offers Made: 0 (Penalty: 0 points)

P1 Final Score: 300 (Max Path Score: 300)
P2 Final Score: 250 (Max Path Score: 250)

WINNER: Player 1 (p1)
