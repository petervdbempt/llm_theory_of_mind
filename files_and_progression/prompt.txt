GAME RULES:
- You are Player {1 or 2} in the Colored Trails game, and your opponent is Player {2 or 1}.
- Your objective is to move as close as possible to your goal location.
- You can only move to adjacent tiles, not diagonally.
- Each move costs one chip of the same color as the tile you move onto.
- You do not need to pay for the start location, but you do need to pay for the goal location.
- Before moving, a negotiation phase takes place, where the two players may propose any redistribution of chips (e.g., 1-for-1, 3-for-1, 1-for-2, etc.).
- If the proposal is rejected, it becomes the other player's turn to propose. If the proposal is accepted or if a player passes, the redistribution becomes
final and the negotiation immediately ends.
- Negotiation can continue for up to 5 rounds, alternating turns after each rejection.
- After a trade or a pass, both players immediately try to move as close as possible to their goal location.

SCORING:
- +100 points per step closer to your goal
- +500 points for reaching your goal
- +50 points for each unused chip
- -1 point per negotiation round
